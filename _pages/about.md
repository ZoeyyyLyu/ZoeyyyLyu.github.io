I am an associate research scientist at [Motor Speech Lab, New York University](https://wp.nyu.edu/grigoslab/). My primary role involves conducting statistical analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for children with childhood apraxia of speech, utilizing data from clinical experiments. I'm also a part-time fiscal policy analyst at [FPWA](https://www.fpwa.org) doing data analysis and visulizations for New York City budget and revenue data. 

I completed my Master's degree in Applied Statistics in Social Science Research at New York University this year. Prior to joining NYU, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Financial Statistics from The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

I have a broad interest in statistical methodology, particularly in multi-level modeling, causal inference, data visualizations, and gtheir applications in social sciences contexts, such as policy and education.

Ongoing Project
------
**Unmodeled Interaction in Binary Dependent Variable Model** \
Collaborator: Prof. Bryant Moy        June 2023- Present	\
Iâ€™m collaborating with Prof. Moy on specifying the unmodeled interaction. We focused on the binary dependent variable model and utilized Neural Networks as a supplementary tool to help to identify the model specification.
