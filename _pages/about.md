I am a pathologist at [Motor Speech Lab, New York University](https://wp.nyu.edu/grigoslab/). I'm also a part-time fiscal policy analyst at [FPWA](https://www.fpwa.org). I completed my Master's degree in Applied Statistics at New York University this year. Prior to joining NYU, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Financial Statistics from The Chinese University of Hong Kong.
