 [Course offering](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/courses/intermediate-quantitative-methods-general-linear-model/) 

I was the course assistant of APSTA-GE 2003 Intermediate Quantitative Methods in Fall 2022 at Department of Applied Statistics, Social Science, and Humanities. I led weekly lab sessions to teach R programming and review statistical methods/concepts. This is a graduate level course designed to meet the data analytic needs of the doctoral students whose dissertation relies on the analysis of quantitative data. 

The course covers multiple regression, analysis of covariance, multivariate analysis of variance and covariance, categorical data analysis, odds, rations, standardization, log linear models, logistic regression. Other topics include multinominal logistic models, survival analysis, principle components, and factor analysis.
