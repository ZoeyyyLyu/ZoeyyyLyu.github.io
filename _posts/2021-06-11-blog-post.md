### Gender Peer Effects on Students’ Academic and Noncognitive Outcomes: Evidence and Mechanisms
Jie Gong, Yi Lu and Hong Song, 2019, _Journal of Human Resources_

**Data**: China Education Panel Survey 2014 (CEPS 2014)
**Clarification**: noncognitive outcome: mental stress, social acclimation and general satisfaction in school.
**Caveats**: No strong support for ability-based spillover from female students.


### Main takeaway:
This paper examines gender peer effects on students’ academic and non-cognitive outcomes 
- **higher proportion of female peers in class improves students’ test scores and noncognitive outcomes, which include their social acclimation and general satisfaction in school.** ⇒10% increase in the proportion of female classmates raises students’ test scores by 10.2% of agi standard deviation and improves their social acclimation and satisfaction in school by 7.7% of a standard deviation.
- **Heterogeneity of gender peer effects.** ⇒the positive effect on test score is stronger among male students, or when the teacher is male. *(**Heterogeneity**: differences across the units being studied)
