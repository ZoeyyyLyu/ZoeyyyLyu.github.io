excerpt: "This research examined the relationship between auditory-perceptual ratings of word accuracy and measures of speech motor timing and variability at pre- and post-treatment in children with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS). We found 1) a negative relationship between auditory-perceptual measures of word accuracy and movement variability; 2) participants who demonstrated the poorest performance at treatment onset displayed the most significant gains."
