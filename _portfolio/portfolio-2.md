title: "A Multiple Single-Case Experimental Design: DTTC Treatment in young children"
excerpt: "We used a multiple single-case experimental design to examine the use of DTTC in children with childhood apraxia of speech over six weeks of intervention. A linear mixed effect model was used to estimate the change in word accuracy for treated and untreated words across all children from Baseline to Post- treatment and to Maintenance. A Quasi-Poisson regression model was used to estimate mean change and calculate the effect size per individual child and at the word level. "

**Overview**

Dynamic Temporal Tactile Cueing (DTTC) is a treatment approach designed for children with severe childhood apraxia of speech, yet the use of DTTC with children younger than three-years of age has not been examined. We used a multiple single-case experimental design to examine the use of DTTC in children with childhood apraxia of speech over six weeks of intervention. A linear mixed effect model was used to estimate the change in word accuracy for treated and untreated words across all children from Baseline to Post- treatment and to Maintenance. A Quasi-Poisson regression model was used to estimate mean change and calculate the effect size per individual child and at the word level. 


**Method**

A multiple single-case design was used to examine the use of DTTC in children with childhood apraxia of speech (aged 2.5-5 years) over the course of six weeks of intervention. Changes in word accuracy were measured in treated words from Baseline to Post- treatment and from Baseline to Maintenance (six weeks post treatment). Generalization of word accuracy changes to matched untreated words was also examined. A linear mixed effect model was used to estimate the change in word accuracy for treated and untreated words across all children from Baseline to Post- treatment and to Maintenance. A Quasi-Poisson regression model was used to estimate mean change and calculate the effect size per individual child and at the word level.


**Results**

 Group level analyses revealed significant changes in word accuracy for treated and untreated words at Post-treatment and Maintenance. At the child level, six of seven children displayed medium to large effect sizes where word accuracy increased in an average of 3.4/5 words across all children. Each child displayed some degree of generalization to untreated targets, specifically for words with the same syllable shape as the treated words.
