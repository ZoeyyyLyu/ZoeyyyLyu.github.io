title: "[Methodology] Unmodeled Interaction in Binary Dependent Variable Model"
collection: publications
excerpt: "Under social sciences contexts, factors exhibit various forms of correlation, and it's not easy for reseachers to capture the correct relationships. Incorrect model specification can bring unmodeled interactions which further causes bias in estimation and predictions. In this project, We focused on the unmodeled interaction in logistic regression and tried to utilize Neural Networks as a supplementary tool to help to identify the model specification. "
