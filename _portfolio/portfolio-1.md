In this project, I used Tableau to create a visualization depicting the revenue inflow and the adopted budget for New York City over the past decade. The data was scraped from the database of city comptroller's office.

The primary sources of city revenue include taxes, federal funds, and state funds. I visualized the allocation of Federal and State grants to various city agencies and conducted an analysis of their trends. This visualization offers insights into the overall funding situation of the city. From this visualization, we can see that the federal and state grants to human services agencies is not comprative to its citywide overall trend. Therfore, we can conclude that human services agencies are experiencing significant budget cuts and are currently underfunded.--->
